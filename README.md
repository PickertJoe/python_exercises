# Elementary Python Exercises

**Welcome to my GitHub!**

This repository contains my work on some the exercises included in Al Sweigart's
excellent guidebook *Python Crash Course*.

Although I was introduced to programming through C++, this book has served as an excellent resource
for brushing up on my coding fundamentals, only this time in Python.

Stay tuned for future updates and exciting projects as I continue to build my skillset in Python!

Other considerations:
* All exercises are meant to be run in Python 3
* All code was written using SublimeText
* All files contain several exercises directly pertinent to a different chapter of Sweigart's book
* The "text_files" directory contains a few larger text documents used for the data file and analysis exercises
