# Elementary Python Exercises

**Welcome to my GitHub!**

This repository contains my work on some the exercises included in Eric Matthes'
excellent guidebook *Python Crash Course* (PCC).

Although I was introduced to programming through C++, this book has served as an excellent resource
for brushing up on my coding fundamentals, only this time in Python.

* "14ers_Project" : a Django-based web app with minimal front end development; designed
alongside the exercises in PCC's web development project.

* "API:Data_Visualizations" : contains a variety of exercises involving API calls, manipulating data from
web-based resources (both JSON and CSV formats), and plotting data using the matplotlib and pygal packages

* "Basics Exercises" : contains simple exercises that helped refresh my knowledge of for/while loops, functions,
classes, branching statements, and other elementary programming tools.

* "Learning_Log" : a Django-based web app built by Eric Matthes for the purposes of his book. Note that this folder is **NOT**
my original work. I simply followed his coding step-by-step to cement the lessons surrounding it.

* "Numerical_Modeling": contains a few exercises involving the random generation and visualization of data

* "Text_Analysis": contains a few exercises involving the reading and writing of text files in Python

* "chapter_10 & chapter_16": folders branched from [Matthes' GitHub](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc) to facilitate the
text analysis and data visualization exercises.

**Other considerations:**
* All exercises were writting in Python 3.7.3
* All code was written using SublimeText
